# Fire&Grain - a site of wood

## Description

 This is a site built around a love for wood and a love for making. It is an exposition of design and craft forged together in a harmonious web environment.  From layout to content, I want solicit a feeling of flow and comfort, paralleling the same experience when one works with wood.

## Custom CSS Classes

``` The class(es) I created are:
 1-- .banner
This class uses a height: vh allowing the background image to be seen full screen and remained fixed to the
background when the end-user loads the page.  It also uses multiple background properties to adjust positioning for the image.
```
```
 2-- .grid__first
This class utilizes flexbox in order to create a multi-column layout for text in the section.  Using the display
property to set the flexbox and the flex-flow property to set direction and wrap in the same code line.  This sets up
the ability to easily manipulate the responsive design by use of media queries.  This same class selector is used in
media queries that change the direction properties and the max-width properties of the content boxes, thus allowing a
responsive design.
 ```

## Custom JavaScript Functions

``` The javascript functions I created are: 

1-- $(document).ready(function)
This is a jquery function that is located in the app--topscroll.js file that animates a button that appears once the page has been scrolled past 120px.  An icon with an up-arrow appears in the bottom right hand corner of the screen, that when clicked or touched, will scroll the page back to the top.
```
```
2-- function initMap ()
This is 
```
